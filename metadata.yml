    bio: |
      (M'76--SM'81--F'87) and all authors may include 
      biographies. Biographies are often not included in conference-related
      papers. This author became a Member (M) of IEEE in 1976, a Senior
      Member (SM) in 1981, and a Fellow (F) in 1987. The first paragraph may
      contain a place and/or date of birth (list place, then date). Next,
      the author's educational background is listed. The degrees should be
      listed with type of degree in what field, which institution, city,
      state, and country, and year the degree was earned. The author's major
      field of study should be lower-cased. 

      The second paragraph uses the pronoun of the person (he or she) and not the 
      author's last name. It lists military and work experience, including summer 
      and fellowship jobs. Job titles are capitalized. The current job must have a 
      location; previous positions may be listed 
      without one. Information concerning previous publications may be included. 
      Try not to list more than three books or published articles. The format for 
      listing publishers of a book within the biography is: title of book 
      (publisher name, year) similar to a reference. Current and previous research 
      interests end the paragraph. The third paragraph begins with the author's 
      title and last name (e.g., Dr.\ Smith, Prof.\ Jones, Mr.\ Kajor, Ms.\ Hunter). 
      List any memberships in professional societies other than the IEEE. Finally, 
      list any awards and work for IEEE committees and publications. If a 
      photograph is provided, it should be of good quality, and 
      professional-looking. Following are two examples of an author's biography.

abstract: |
      The popularity of the Android Operating System in the smartphone market has attracted lots of malware into its ecosystem.
      To accurately detect these malware, many of the existing works use machine learning and deep learning-based methods,
      in which feature extraction methods were used to extract fixed-size numerical feature vectors using the files present inside the Android Application Package (APK).
      Recently, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based methods applied on the Function Call Graph (FCG) extracted from the APK are gaining momentum in Android Malware detection,
      as GCN are effective at learning tasks on variable sized graphs such as FCG, and FCG sufficiently captures the structure and behaviour of an APK.
      However, the FCG lacks the information about callback methods as the Android Application Programming Interface (API) is event-driven.
      To overcome this limitation, we propose enhancing the FCG as eFCG (enhanced-FCG) using the callback information extracted using Android Framework space analysis.
      Further, we add permission - API method relationships to eFCG. The eFCG is reduced using node contraction based on the classes to get R-eFCG (Reduced eFCG).
      The eFCG and R-eFCG are then given as the inputs to the Heterogeneous GCN models to get the prediction of malicious behaviour of the APK.
      To test the effectiveness of the proposed model, we conducted an ablation study by removing various components of eFCG and R-eFCG.
      Further, we experimented with a varying number of GCN layers and found that the model using R-eFCG using all components of it with four convolution layers achieved a maximum accuracy of 96.28%.
